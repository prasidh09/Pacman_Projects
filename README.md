Pacman_Projects
===============

Application of AI concepts to the PacMan game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project focusses on applying AI concepts such as uninformed and informed state space search, 
probabilistic inference and reinforcement learning to playing pacman. I implemented general search 
algorithms, Minimax, alpha beta pruning along with an efficient evaluation function to the pacman 
scenario to find paths through the maze. As a result of this experience, I have been able to 
understand real world AI problems.
